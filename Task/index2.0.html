<header><h1>About me and my goals:</h1></header>
<section><p>
My name is Kieran Schutte and i have always had an attraction towards technology and how software functions the way it does. <br>
   I have always wanted to learn and be able to write code for myself so that i may be able to design my own apps and webpages. <br>
   As a person i would say that i am very sport but at the same time i am more than happy to sit at home and relax all day. <br>
   My passion is to learn more about coding and programming and my motivation is simply because i enjoy the feeling of a successful program. <br>
   I would like to be a successful Software Engineer one day.
